        "1 What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?\n",
        "\n",
        "SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It aims to find the hyperplane (decision boundary) that best separates data points of different classes by maximizing the margin between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2 What is the difference between Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Hard Margin SVM: Used when the data is linearly separable. It creates a decision boundary where no data points are allowed on the wrong side of the hyperplane. Soft Margin SVM: Used when the data is not perfectly separable. It allows some misclassification of data points but tries to balance maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error, controlled by a parameter\n",
        "\n",
        "**3 What is the mathematical intuition behind SVM? **\n",
        "\n",
        "SVM works by transforming the data into a higher-dimensional space where a hyperplane can be used to separate the classes. The goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the closest points from each class (the support vectors).\n",
        "\n",
        "4 What is the role of Lagrange Multipliers in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lagrange multipliers are used to convert the constrained optimization problem in SVM (maximizing the margin subject to constraints that points must be classified correctly) into an unconstrained one. This allows for the use of optimization techniques to find the optimal hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "5 What are Support Vectors in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Support vectors are the data points that are closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane). These points are critical as they define the position and orientation of the hyperplane. They are the ones that determine the margin of the SVM model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6 What is a Support Vector Classifier (SVC)?\n",
        "\n",
        "SVC is a specific implementation of SVM for classification tasks. It learns the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, making it suitable for binary and multiclass classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "7 What is a Support Vector Regressor (SVR)?\n",
        "\n",
        "SVR is a variant of SVM used for regression tasks. Instead of separating data into classes, it tries to fit a function that has at most a certain margin of tolerance (controlled by a parameter 𝜖 ϵ) between the actual data points and the predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "8 What is the Kernel Trick in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "The kernel trick allows SVM to operate in higher-dimensional feature spaces without explicitly computing the coordinates of the data in that space. This is done by using a kernel function (such as the polynomial or radial basis function (RBF) kernel) to calculate the dot product in the higher-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "9 Compare Linear Kernel, Polynomial Kernel, and RBF Kernel:\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Kernel: Suitable for linearly separable data. It computes the dot product of input vectors directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polynomial Kernel: Useful for non-linear data. It computes the dot product raised to a power d, allowing for curved decision boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "RBF Kernel: The most commonly used kernel in SVM. It projects data into an infinite-dimensional space, allowing complex decision boundaries. It computes the similarity between data points based on their Euclidean distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "10 What is the effect of the C parameter in SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "The C parameter controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification error. A high value of C tries to classify all training points correctly, possibly leading to overfitting. A lower C allows more misclassification but can improve generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "11 What is the role of the Gamma parameter in RBF Kernel SVM?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Gamma parameter in RBF kernel determines the influence of a single training example. A small value of gamma means a far-reaching influence, while a large gamma means that each training point has a small influence, leading to a more complex decision boundary.\n",
        "\n",
        "12 What is the Naïve Bayes classifier, and why is it called \"Naïve\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem that assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class. The term \"naïve\" comes from this assumption, which is often unrealistic but still works well in many cases, especially for text classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "13 What is Bayes’ Theorem?\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of a class 𝐶 C given observed features 𝑋 X using the formula: 𝑃 ( 𝐶 ∣ 𝑋 )\n",
        "𝑃 ( 𝑋 ∣ 𝐶 ) 𝑃 ( 𝐶 ) 𝑃 ( 𝑋 ) P(C∣X)= P(X) P(X∣C)P(C)​\n",
        "\n",
        "where 𝑃 ( 𝐶 ∣ 𝑋 ) P(C∣X) is the posterior probability of the class given the features, 𝑃 ( 𝑋 ∣ 𝐶 ) P(X∣C) is the likelihood, 𝑃 ( 𝐶 ) P(C) is the prior probability of the class, and 𝑃 ( 𝑋 ) P(X) is the evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14 Explain the differences between Gaussian Naïve BayesMultinomial Naïve Bayes, and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Gaussian Naïve Bayes: Assumes that the features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multinomial Naïve Bayes: Assumes that the features (especially used for text classification) are counts or frequencies of events (e.g., word counts in text).\n",
        "\n",
        "Bernoulli Naïve Bayes: Assumes that the features are binary (e.g., the presence or absence of a word in text classification).\n",
        "\n",
        "15 When should you use Gaussian Naïve Bayes over other variants?\n",
        "\n",
        "Gaussian Naïve Bayes is ideal when the features are continuous and can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution. It is suitable for cases where the feature values are real numbers, such as in medical data with continuous attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16 What are the key assumptions made by Naïve Bayes?\n",
        "\n",
        "The key assumption in Naïve Bayes is the conditional independence of features given the class. This assumption simplifies the computation of the likelihood term 𝑃 ( 𝑋 ∣ 𝐶 ) P(X∣C) as the product of individual feature probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "17 What are the advantages and disadvantages of Naïve Bayes?\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "Simple and easy to implement. Efficient with large datasets. Works well for text classification (e.g., spam detection).\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "The conditional independence assumption is often unrealistic. It doesn't work well when features are highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "18 Why is Naïve Bayes a good choice for text classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes works well for text classification because it models the conditional independence between words in the documents, which makes it computationally efficient and effective for tasks like spam detection or sentiment analysis, even with large vocabularies.\n",
        "\n",
        "19 Compare SVM and Naïve Bayes for classification tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "SVM is more powerful when the decision boundary is complex and non-linear. It works well for small to medium-sized datasets with many features, especially when there is a clear margin of separation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes, on the other hand, is more efficient and works well when the features are independent, and the data is relatively simple. It is often used in text classification due to its simplicity and speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "20 How does Laplace Smoothing help in Naïve Bayes?\n",
        "\n",
        "Laplace Smoothing (also called additive smoothing) is used in Naïve Bayes to handle the problem of zero probabilities when a feature value does not appear in the training set for a particular class. It adds a small constant (usually 1) to the count of each feature to ensure that all features have a non-zero probability.\n",
